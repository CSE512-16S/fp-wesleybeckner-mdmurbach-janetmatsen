## Decision Trees and Random Forests for Photoluminescence Prediction
Machine learning and high performance computing are revolutionizing strategies used to engineer new materials.  
By creating automated and adaptive experimental architectures, previously insermountable design spaces can now be considered \cite{UW}. 
In this spirit, this work aims to illustrate the performance of random forests as implemented in sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestRegressor \cite{scikit-learn} at predicting photoluminescence for perovskite solar cells. 
The tutorial is meant to be a creative exploration space to introduce other researchers and students to one of the most commonly used machine learning algorithms.
