Goal: Visualize our scikit-learn tree in D3
Status: not convinced this is good code to leverage.
    Switch to one based on http://www.d3noob.org/2014/01/tree-diagrams-in-d3js_11.html, 
    as in simplest_tree_example

Steps:
    - run a working copy of someone else's tree, where data is loaded in from .json
        - used what I learned in simplest_tree_example 
    - switch data to our sklearn tree for our images. 
Status:
    - got their data to load, but no tree shows. 

The python3 equivalent of python -m SimpleHTTPServer:
python3 -m http.server
